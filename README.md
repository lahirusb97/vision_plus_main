## üîí Security & Compliance

- All sensitive routes protected by authentication and role checks.
- Patient and order data is never cached or stored insecurely on the client.
- All API calls use secure HTTPS and backend CORS rules.
- Soft-delete and audit trails for all critical data.

---

## üß™ Testing & Quality

- Unit and UI tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and Testing Library
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Pre-deploy and CI test scripts included

---

## üìù Real-world & Edge Case Considerations

- Medical/Healthcare: Validate all patient identifiers (NIC, phone, etc.) before submission.
- Multi-branch: All branch-specific operations validate session/branch selection.
- Concurrency: Always check for stale data on update (e.g., double submit, browser tab issues).
- User Actions: Guard against accidental deletion (soft-delete everywhere possible).
