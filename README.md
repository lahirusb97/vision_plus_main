UI & UX Principles
Accessibility: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly.

Consistency: MUI theming and layout components for predictable, professional UI.

Responsiveness: Optimized for desktop and tablet, with mobile-first layouts.

Feedback: Loading states, error boundaries, toast notifications (via react-hot-toast).

Security: All sensitive actions require auth; sensitive data never cached client-side.

Security & Compliance
Authentication & Route Guarding:

Uses <LoginProtectedRoute /> and <ProtectedChildRoute /> for all sensitive routes.

No direct access to protected pages without valid login/session.

Role Checks:

UI elements and API actions are hidden or blocked based on user role (front and backend).

Medical Data Privacy:

No sensitive PII or medical data stored on the client; always fetched fresh from secure API.

All API calls proxied through /api with CORS and HTTPS enforced.

Testing
Unit/Component Tests:

Written with Vitest + @testing-library/react

Run all tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run test
# or for UI test runner:
npm run test:ui
CI-ready:

Lint and test before deploy:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run lint
npm run test

‚ö†Ô∏è Real-world & Edge Case Considerations
Medical/Healthcare: Always validate patient identifiers (NIC, phone, etc.) before submission.

Multi-branch: All branch-specific operations must validate session/branch selection.

Concurrency: Always check for stale data on update (e.g., double submit or browser tab issues).

User Actions: Guard against accidental deletion (soft-delete everywhere possible)
